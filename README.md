# iris-species-detection
We try to create a Machine Learning Model using Logistic Regression to help us classify a given Iris flower species into three - Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. We take the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width as the features to train into consideration.
